# This notebook intends to explain the effects of hyperparametric optimization on model's performance.
# 
# ## Hyperparametric Optimization
# 
# Hyperparameters are those parameters of a model, which can't be found out during training of our model. They are not directly learned within the estimator. In scikit-learn they are passed as arguments to the constructor of the estimator classes. Typical examples include `C`, `kernel` and `gamma` for Support Vector Classifier, `alpha` for Lasso, `max_depth` and `min_samples_leaf` in decision tress etc.
# 
# The choice of hyperparameters can greatly influence model predictions. In scikit-learn, if we simply train a model, without passing the values of these hyperparameters, the model is trained on the default values. But, to improve model accuracy and to make our model robust, we must find the optimal values of the hyperparameters. 
# 
# One way to find the optimal hyperparameters is to train our model on different values of these hyperparameters and check accuracy on the validation set. In case of multiple hyperparameters, we need to make a grid having different values at each node as shown in the diagram below.
#

# 
# The validation error is calculated by testing model accuracy on the validation set after training it on training set using each combination of hyperparameters. To understand training, validation and testing errors, [please follow this link](https://datamaniac.tech/data_science/understanding-training-testing-and-validation-errors/).
# 
# ## Scikit-Learn Implementation
# 
# Sklearn provides us a method to perform above grid operations easily using grid_search_cv. We will look at its implementation in this notebook. View this notebook on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prasun2106/steps-for-hyperparametric-optimization)

# We can see that the f1 score for the training set is 1 and for the testing set it is 0.7. The large difference in training and testing f1 score denotes that we are dealing with the case of high variance (or overfitting). This fact can be understood on the basis of any standard model complexity graph which is as shown below:

              'min_samples_split':np.arange(2,10),
               'min_samples_leaf': np.arange(1,10)}

#Make scorer

#Make Grid Seach Object
grid_obj = GridSearchCV(clf, parameters, scoring=scorer)

#Fit
grid_obj.fit(X_train, y_train)

#Find the best estimator
best_clf = grid_obj.best_estimator_


# In[22]:


#Predict using the best clf
y_pred_grid = best_clf.predict(X_test)
y_pred_grid_train = best_clf.predict(X_train)


# In[23]:



print(f'training set f1_score without grid search cv ={f1_score(y_pred_train, y_train)}')
print(f'testing set f1_score without grid search cv ={f1_score(y_pred, y_test)}')

print(f'testing set f1_score using grid search ={f1_score(y_pred_grid, y_test)}')


# From the above results, if we are using grid search to optimize hyperparameters, our training set error is close to the testing set error and testing set error has increased too. It means that our model is making better prediction as well as it is able to generalize well.
